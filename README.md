[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra)](https://github.com/15jdberry/github-readme-stats)  
Note:
Top Languages does not indicate the user's skill level or anything like that;
it is a new feature of github-readme-stats and is a GitHub metric determined by which languages I have used most on GitHub.
